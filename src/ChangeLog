GNUSki 0.3

2007-05-30  Rudolf Olah
	* object.c: Coloured trees green.	
	* main.c: Decreased refresh rate to counter-act the weird
	attron/attroff cursor crap.

2007-05-29  Rudolf Olah
	* main.c: Proper scrolling. Generates objects as they pass from
	view.

2007-05-28  Rudolf Olah
	* object.c: Facing is specified when drawing objects (there are a
	lot of objects that have the same facing so there's no need for
	the struct to store that info).
	* main.c: Added the proper controls and screen-scrolling.
	* main.c: Using a refresh rate now and a separate variable to
	control speed. Also keeping track of distance.	

2007-05-25  Rudolf Olah
	* main.c: Converted everything to C.
	* main.c: GNUSki is starting from version 0.1 all over again.

2006-04-19  Rudolf Olah
	* draw.h: Changed the commands around a bit. The clean-up has
	begun.
