GNUSki ChangeLog

Version: 0.2

Big Change
======================
- An object class was created
- Ski dude, rocks and trees are all inheritors from that object class


Bad News
======================
- POSIX Threads do not function apparently. The code has been compiled in Cygwin under Windows 2000 and in Knoppix but to no avail.
- The drawing methods are messed up somewhere, because when skiDude is re-drawn, other objects are re-drawn in line with skiDude.
