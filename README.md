## News and updates
Copied over from the original repo:

- 2007-05-31: It's alive! GNUSki is alive again! I've been working on this for the last few days at a leisurely pace and it's looking fine. A GTK or Qt version is planned!
- 2005-07-01: Plan for 0.3 Drawing methods will be fixed in 0.3. Hopefully we can get the threads working. If they don't work in the next version it's not a problem because we can work on other aspects such as adding jumping and other obstacles (ski lift, Bigfoot, etc.)
